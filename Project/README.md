# phys240project
Project from computational physics class featuring numerical solutions to a wave packet in a 1-D, variable well

1. In the terminal run 'make' to build the executable
2. Use './packetLR' to run the program
    a. Input the barrier Height
    b. Input the potential barrier width
    c. Input wave packet Energy
3. '.dat' files will be created with solutions to the given system configuration
4. Do 'gnuplot movieP.gp' to show the evolution of the wave packet in time, with transmission and refleciton probabilities.
